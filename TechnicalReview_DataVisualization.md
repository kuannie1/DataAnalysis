Technical Review 1 - Software Desgin
Project: Data Visualization


Background and context: What information about your project does the audience need to participate fully in the technical review? You should share enough to make sure your audience understands the questions you are asking, but without going into unnecessary detail.

	Our focus when starting this project was to learn about data analytics and visualization. We wanted to create a product that merged ideas from these two fields, ultimately visualizing any interesting correlations. Right now, we have chosen to explore the correlation between a company’s stock price and public opinion surrounding that company. 
	So far, we have written code that extracts the stock market data and google search data we need as well as explored different options for tools to visualize our data in different ways. The graph we have shown you is an example of something we can currently produce from our code. It shows Chipotle’s changing stock price and public opinion on different dates throughout the year 2015.


Key questions:What do you want to learn from the review? What are the most important decisions your team is currently contemplating? Where might an outside perspective be most helpful? As you select key questions to ask during the review, bear in mind both the time limitations and background of your audience.

	~We would like advice on how to expand upon our project after completing our MVP. 
	~Any specific recommendations on selecting other companies, industries, or visualization methods?
	~We would like to explore possibilities for other ways to analyze our data.


Agenda for technical review session: Be specific about how you plan to use your allotted time. What strategies will you use to communicate with your audience?

    We will start off by giving a brief overview of our project, communicating with our audience through a powerpoint presentation. We chose this format so that we could efficiently show our current progress, code, and current results. We will then open up the room for discussion, prompting input from the audience by voicing our questions and asking for feedback.
