### Second Technical Review
##Lauren Pudvan, Uma Desai, Annie Ku

**Background and context**
Our focus when starting this project was to learn about data analytics and visualization. We wanted to create a product that merged ideas from these two fields, ultimately visualizing any interesting correlations. Right now, we have chosen to explore the correlation between a company’s stock price and public opinion surrounding that company. 
So far, we have written code that extracts the stock market data and google search data and plots it using plot.ly. The graph we have shown you is an example of something we can currently produce from our code. It shows Chipotle’s changing stock price and public opinion on different dates throughout the year 2015. Our next planned step is to add cool, informative components to our graph, such as key events in a company’s history that caused a change in public opinion at a specific data point. We also hope to analyze our results for multiple companies to try to determine a correlation that is strong enough to hopefully make some predictions about future stock price changes.

**Key questions**
What are some other components we can add to our graph that make it more user friendly and informative?
We’re planning to show graphs of a few companies on our webpage to show what our tool can do. What specific recommendations do you have for us regarding companies or groups of companies to feature?
Is there a way to filter out some of the unrelated google info that is making the public opinion data inaccurate?
Any ideas about mitigating our pitfalls?
Weird sentiments
External factors that affect stock prices

**Agenda for technical review session**
We will start by giving an overview of what we currently have and are trying to accomplish next. Then we will use the majority of the time by having a conversation on each of the questions above.
