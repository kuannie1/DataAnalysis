Software Design Final Project Proposal
Annie Ku, Uma Desai, and Lauren Pudvan

The Big Idea: 
MVP: basic interactive graphs showing US companies and demonstrate the relationship over time
Stretch goal: a more expansive visual that incorporates international companies and makes predictions for the future

Learning Goals:
	Using visualization libraries
	Utilizing prediction technologies
	Learning to interact efficiently with different APIs
	Learning about different collaboration strategies
	Building strong teamwork skills

Implementation Plan: 
	Tools: Pygame (data visualization), datasets/APIs (data gathering), indico/machine learning (data analytics and prediction)

Project schedule: 
	Week 1: Decide on a project, write a proposal, plan project steps, define group of companies
	Week 2: Choose data-gathering API, get API keys if needed, figure out steps to make API 	calls and get all data needed, make initial hypotheses
	Week 3: Develop MVP
	Week 4: Perfect MVP, 
	Week 5: Expand on MVP
	Week 6: Finalize product

Collaboration plan: 
	Attempting pair-programming as long as we’re up to speed
		If we start to fall behind schedule→ split project into small parts & assign each part to a team member while maintaining open communication

Risks: 
	One of the biggest risks is finding data that is not consistent in formatting and therefore difficult to filter through or limited in scope.
	Not finding a strong correlation between the two variables we are comparing.

Additional Course Content:
	Integrating multiple APIs
	Advanced data visualization techniques
