# Technical Review 2- Reflection
## Anne Ku, Lauren Pudvan, Uma Desai

### **Feedback and decisions**

### Ways to make our graph more user-friendly:
	- Graph the average public opinion over a few days instead of each day to be able to see more of a trend, or use a line of best fit
	- Adjust a company’s stock price relative to dow or that company’s sector
	- Think about adding a timeline or something to show what real events are happening during the time period being graphed
### Ways to improved accuracy of public opinion results:
	- Have the google search look for the company name in the title of the headline or for multiple references instead of just one
	- Weight entries closer to the top of the google search results
### Companies to feature:
	- H&M or company known for human rights
	- Starbucks
	- Kraft
	- Tyson, McDonalds when FoodInc came out
	- BP and other oil companies (what we decided to focus on now)
	- Big banks or firms like Goldman Sachs

Going forward, we plan to feature at least one of the above groups of companies on our website as interesting example of what our code can discover. We are also planning on weighting entries on the top of the google search results to increase the accuracy of the public opinion results. We are also adding a feature to the graph that allows users to move their cursor over a data point and see what real event happened at that time. We are now wondering, what is a good way to show the trends of multiple companies at once (we tried overlaying and it looks too busy)? Also, what is a good way to include information about the trend of Dow/Nasdaq without making the graph too busy and confusing?


### **Review process reflection**
    
The review went really well for us. We think we provided enough context for our project because we did not have to explain our project again to have a meaningful discussion. We had some specific questions about interpreting the results and some discussion-type ones about taking our project further. We stayed with the planned agenda and got good feedback for all the questions we proposed. Because this discussion went as planned, we did not change our plan much. We are still focusing on the user experience and functionality of our product.

If we were to have another technical review, we would definitely try to demonstrate our problems better. For example, we wanted to demonstrate one of our problems in the last minute, but one member forgot the syntax of pickle on the podium. Other than these small mishaps, though, we think our last technical review plan was successful. As a result, we would do this again if we could.
