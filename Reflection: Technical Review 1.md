#Feedback and Decisions:
###Feedback we received:
####What are areas we can explore after completing our MVP?
######Consider making an interface/webpage where users can input a company/industry and get correlation (expanding from making one graph of correlation to making a tool that finds correlation)
######Considering adding an interactive part that pinpoints key facts about that data point (i.e. key news article headlines, demographics, etc.)
####Do you have specific recommendations on selecting other companies, industries, or visualization methods.
######Looking into various news sources, seeing whose opinions matter
######Consider focusing on food places and analyzing Yelp data
######Consider analyzing data from political topics
######Other possible industries:
        restaurants
        banks
        tech, oil
        verizon/comcast/other ones have bad customer service, but good stocks
        car companies	
####How can we improve the way we are currently analyzing our data?
######Use public opinion polls when possible - they often will provide much more reliable data than sentiment analysis
######Query/google search: there may be a way to search that goes into the results for that particular day
######Look into sources other than google
######business watch,
######market watch
######Bloomberg: representative of business opinion
######Twitter: more representative of public opinion
###Things to work on:
######Investigate accessibility of public opinion polls
######Looking into Google search queries and timestamps
######Looking into the twitter API, other sources (like Business Insider)
######Choose companies to evaluate
######Get data for public opinion so that MVP can be completed!
######Deciding what form our final product will take (webpage?)
###Things we can explore, new questions to explore:
######Whether sentiment analysis really affects stock prices (there are exceptions)
######Explore a variety of industries, seeing which ones are affected by public opinion
######Grouping sentiments by demographics, seeing which groups affect the stock price more
##Review process reflection:
######The review went well, because provided the right amount of context for our audience to fully understand our project so far, we got great advice for our technical questions, and we generated many new ideas to explore. We may have made some of our questions too open ended, resulting in having 1-2 minutes to spare at the end. We went into the technical review with general questions and some uncertainty surrounding the specifics for the stretch goal of our project. Because of this, we asked what people would be interested in knowing so we could plan a more specific stretch goal and work towards that. We received awesome input from the audience about concepts theyâ€™d be interested to see us investigate as well as possible solutions to a few of our more specific, technical questions, and we are now in a great position to move forward with our project. To prepare for the next technical review we should be more precise with our questions and plan out how we will use the time more specifically.
